**Google Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM**

## Project Overview:

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to predict Google’s stock price using historical data and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model. The project focuses on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

> Note: Although deployment was initially planned using FastAPI and Docker, the final version concludes with the trained model due to system issues. Model testing could not be performed.

## Files and Directories:

- `google_stock_price.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, visualization, model training.
- `main.py` – Python script version of the notebook.
- `lstm_model.h5` – Trained LSTM model.
- `keras.json` – Configuration related to Keras backend.
- `requirements.txt` – List of required Python packages.
- `Dockerfile` – Containerization script (initial deployment plan).
- `.docker/` – (Optional) Contains supporting Docker resources.
